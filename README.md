# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a web application that would help me learn and test the skills I was taught in my prework course. I built this project as an easy way to review concepts that I learned while at the same time using the skills being taught in the course. This project helped solved the issues of not having previous experience with HTML, CSS, GitHub, and JavaScript while also creating an easy way to review the topics. I learned many things from this project, but mostly how these topics are necessary for every project I will be doing in the UW-Madison bootcamp and in my future career.
